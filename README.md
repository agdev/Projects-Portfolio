      <h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>
      <h4>Project Objectives</h1>
      <p>By utilizing clustering algorithms, we aim to provide actionable insights into customer preferences and behavior patterns, which will ultimately drive more effective customer engagement and increase profitability.

Understand Customer Behavior: Identify key patterns in customer purchasing habits, such as frequency of purchases, total spend, product preferences, and discount sensitivity. Create Customer Segments: Group customers into distinct segments based on their transactional data (e.g., purchase history, frequency, order quantity, discount usage, and profitability). Analyze Customer Segments: Understand the characteristics of each segment to tailor business strategies for different customer groups, such as high-value customers, occasional buyers, and discount-driven shoppers. Provide Strategic Recommendations: Based on the segmentation results, suggest marketing, sales, and retention strategies to target each customer segment effectively.</p>
